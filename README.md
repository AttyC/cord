# Story Grid

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I used a simple stylesheet as per the instructions to be keep within the time constraints. 

## Images
  
I used images from Unspalsh and in a real app would add the photographer credits.
