# Story Grid

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I used a simple stylesheet as per the instructions to be keep within the time constraints. 

## To run the app

Clone this repo into Terminal (on a Mac)

Install the packages with ```yarn install```
  
Run the code with ```yarn start```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
  
## Images
  
I used images from Unsplash and in a real app would add the photographer credits.
